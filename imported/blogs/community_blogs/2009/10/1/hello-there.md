So, it has been a bit since my last post.

I have been working pretty hard here lately @ [Blizzard][1]. Can't really talk about what, just tons and tons of C# work.

In some "work related" news, Blizzard has just unveiled its completely revamped website and its pretty damn slick, not bad for a 10 year makeover.

Also, if you haven't heard, a new WoW expansion is under development, I am pretty excited about this one.

In other news, I have been working tons, and haven't really done much of anything else. I did however update to Adobe CS4 and am learning the new features in Photoshop and Illustrator. I have also found myself re-installing Fruity Loops, guess I got some sort of itch to scratch.

Anyway, Halloween is coming up, got a big party planned at the house, and tons of horror movies planned to watch, so hopefully I can update this blog a bit more frequently in the near future eh?
