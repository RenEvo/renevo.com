<p>So, it has been a bit since my last post.</p>  <p>I have been working pretty hard here lately @ <a href="http://www.blizzard.com" target="_blank">Blizzard</a>. Can’t really talk about what, just tons and tons of C# work.</p>  <p>In some “work related” news, Blizzard has just unveiled its completely revamped website and its pretty damn slick, not bad for a 10 year makeover.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.blizzard.com" target="_blank"><img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;border-top:0px;margin-right:auto;border-right:0px;" border="0" src="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/news/images/09-09/thumb-newblizz.jpg" /></a></p>  <p>Also, if you haven’t heard, a new WoW expansion is under development, I am pretty excited about this one.</p>  <p>In other news, I have been working tons, and haven’t really done much of anything else. I did however update to Adobe CS4 and am learning the new features in Photoshop and Illustrator. I have also found myself re-installing Fruity Loops, guess I got some sort of itch to scratch.</p>  <p>Anyway, Halloween is coming up, got a big party planned at the house, and tons of horror movies planned to watch, so hopefully I can update this blog a bit more frequently in the near future eh?</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2254" width="1" height="1">
