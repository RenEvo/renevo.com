So last month about mid-way through I got the message from [Pandora][2]'s online site that my hours were up. In case you didn't know, due to the final settlement with [Pandora][2] and the record companies, they have to limit people to 40 hours a month. Well, I listen to it all day long at work, so this didn't cut it. Enter [Pandora One][3]. Basically, [Pandora One][3] is a $36 a year upgrade that allows me to listen without limitations, without commercials, 5 hours between "are you still listening" messages, as well as getting better quality and a better playlist it seems. At roughly $3 a month, seriously worth the upgrade. The application runs inside of [Adobe Air][4], so if you already have an app like [TweetDeck][5], you already have the base installed. It has a nice run from tray ability (left side of the image is the tray icon menu) which makes it pretty much totally in the background.

All in all, I say it is worth the upgrade, but then again I am an audiophile who listens to music pretty much the entire time I am on the computer.
