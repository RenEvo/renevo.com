<p>An update to the <a href="http://lifegiverproject.org/" target="_blank">Eric De La Cruz thing</a>, they have raised almost $660k with the help of names like Trent Reznor and Tony Hawk, got approval from Medicare because they have the $150k for that, now <a href="http://writechic.wordpress.com/2009/05/24/abandon-hope-all-ye-who-enter-ucla-transplant-center/" target="_blank">UCLA is saying they need supplemental insurance</a>, which he wonâ€™t be able to get due to his condition.</p>  <p>This is just becoming serious bullshit. <a href="http://healthcare.change.org/actions/view/no_more_red_tape_speak_up_and_save_a_life" target="_blank">You can try to do something about it.</a></p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2214" width="1" height="1">
