![][1] Well, I have been with my new employer for just over a week now, and it has been a dream come true. It is hands down one of the best companies that I have seen, and worked for, as well as the people being great.

Coming from my past jobs, I was always the lead, the decision maker, the guy to go to when things went wrong. Now, I am thankfully put into a position where there are people with more knowledge than myself that I can learn from and grow considerably through their insight and experience. I still have my own knowledge and experiences that I hope I can (and am) contributing to the team, but to have such a great team of developers who are just as, and even more, programming minded as myself is a great growth spurt for myself waiting to happen. Already I have learned so much, and there is only tons more to learn and teach.

Anyway, as always, you will never find any specifics about my job, or especially any information about the company I work for, but from time to time I will be posting things I learn on my own here and there on the site. I am still in a huge learning curve on the projects I am working on, so by the time I get home I am pretty mind blasted, once I get back into the flow, I am sure you will see more site updates here.

For now, enjoy the thinking monkey.
