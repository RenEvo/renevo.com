<p>So today I received a notification via windows update that I had a critical windows update, Internet Explorer 8 x64. Since I use Google Chrome anyway, I figured, what the hell right?</p>  <p>After a reboot (dumb), I launched it, went directly to this site, everything seemed fine, then went to Facebook. After 10 seconds of looking at Facebook being completely bonked, what is a normal user supposed to do? The “compatibility mode” that I remember hearing about on tech blogs might be able to be used, but what about the normal Joe visitor?</p>  <p>Anyway, just thought I would chime in and say that I am still happy with my Google Chrome.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2215" width="1" height="1">
