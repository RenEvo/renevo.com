So, I was feeling a bit antsy at work today, and the results show clearly below.

![image][1]

Above you see a wonderful JSON query to the [stackoverflow][2] site pulling my reputation for the day, highlighting answers in green, items with up and down votes in yellow, and (what i hid) answers with no up votes and all down votes in red. Items with up votes that are not answers and don't have down votes simply show in vanilla white.

In the task bar it shows my my reputation that I have earned in total for the day.

This is a fun tool, and I hope to add a date selector as well as a tray icon, it is super low bandwidth to the server, as it only pulls on demand, not on a timer or anything.

I realize there are [a lot of other tools just like this one][3], but I had fun learning how to interact with JSON.

If anyone is interested in it, let me know, I might toss it up open source on [Google code][4] or [Codeplex][5].
