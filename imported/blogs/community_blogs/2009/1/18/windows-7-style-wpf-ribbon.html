<p>Included in .Net 4.0 is the new Windows 7 style Ribbon. Unfortunately right now it seems that it is only available for WPF, but even then it is really cool for Microsoft to finally give us a way to create applications that match their styling.</p>  <p>Below is a small WPF application I made (with a lot of guess work, seems that the documentation isn’t available yet) using the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/wpf" target="_blank">WPF Futures</a> and <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/wpf/Wiki/View.aspx?title=WPF%20Ribbon%20Preview" target="_blank">Licensed Office 2007 Ribbon Control</a> components. The first view is with the default Windows 7 ribbon, and the second view (with a single line of code) is the Office 2007 silver and blue style.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_35DE15A1.png"><img title="image" style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;display:inline;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="185" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_thumb_652F8B2B.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_155966A0.png"><img title="image" style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;display:inline;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="184" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_thumb_3DF7D2A7.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_124708AB.png"><img title="image" style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;display:inline;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="183" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_thumb_3AE574B2.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Personally, I prefer the Windows 7 look over the “Big Bubble” thingy, but you could easily allow users to decide which one to use.</p>  <p>I will probably try to do a write up of how I got this working, but tonight I am too busy playing.&#160; I may even build a notepad replacement as that seems to be the only app in Windows 7 that didn’t get a Ribbon.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2142" width="1" height="1">
