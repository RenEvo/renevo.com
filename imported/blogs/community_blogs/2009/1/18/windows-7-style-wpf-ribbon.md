Included in .Net 4.0 is the new Windows 7 style Ribbon. Unfortunately right now it seems that it is only available for WPF, but even then it is really cool for Microsoft to finally give us a way to create applications that match their styling.

Below is a small WPF application I made (with a lot of guess work, seems that the documentation isn't available yet) using the [WPF Futures][1] and [Licensed Office 2007 Ribbon Control][2] components. The first view is with the default Windows 7 ribbon, and the second view (with a single line of code) is the Office 2007 silver and blue style.

Personally, I prefer the Windows 7 look over the "Big Bubble" thingy, but you could easily allow users to decide which one to use.

I will probably try to do a write up of how I got this working, but tonight I am too busy playing.Â  I may even build a notepad replacement as that seems to be the only app in Windows 7 that didn't get a Ribbon.
