So today, I got a hair up my bum to figure out where those strange little images come from on YouTube.

Turns out, its pretty darn simple. I have only been able to find 4 different ones so far, I am sure there are more, and I am sure there is probably documentation somewhere on the web.

Anyway, here are the ones I have found, replace the {0} with the video id (v= from the url)

Big one, usually used on YouTube.com for the spotlight – looks like these are 480x360

The next 3 are various parts of the video, with some investigation, you could probably find the exact formula for finding the exact time frames, but… yah.  These are 120x90 from what I have found, it is also what Facebook and others use to display the preview.
