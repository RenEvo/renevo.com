<p>Recently my media sharing server on Vista Ultimate stopped working and none of my other PC’s, including my PS3, could use it.&#160; After a LOT of digging around I did the following fixes.</p>  <p>First, apply this registry fix, as well as download the CCCP codecs.</p>  <p>Lastly, reset the permissions on my personal folders so that the WMPNetworkSvc had Read and List folder contents permissions.</p>  <p>Everything is back up and running, thankfully….</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2237" width="1" height="1">
