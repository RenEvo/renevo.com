So, it has been a little over a week since my last post, this week has been pretty tight with work.

A few things have popped up in the last few days that have finalized some of the design aspects of the website.  For one, I have decided against the "Entire Post" blog posts, this model didn't work well with the "[Facebook][1]/[Twitter][2]" type of update system I am planning. Luckily [Windows Live Writer][3] supports the ability to create "Excerpts" via the Metablog API and the [Windows Live Writer][3] ["Supports Excerpts" blog configuration][4]. This is a bit more work for me for posting new blogs, but simply pasting a paragraph from the post should do suffice for most cases.

I will hopefully start jotting down some wireframes this week for the basic layouts so I can get started with the feature requirements and get cranking on the code… Which is what this is all about right?

More coming soon…
