<p>Been dealing with the Facebook services here lately and they use the epoch time GMT 0 to time stamp everything, this is a stupid simple way to find out the real time.</p>  <div class="csharpcode">   <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   1:  </span>DateTime.Parse(<span class="str">&quot;1/1/1970&quot;</span>).AddSeconds(1244367137).ToLocalTime()</pre>
</div>

<p>And that is simple.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2228" width="1" height="1">
