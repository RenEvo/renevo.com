It is not that I am not looking, on a daily basis I am submitting about 5 resumes, have had quite a few phone interviews, and a few in person interviews, the problem is, I am too expensive, even with a $30k drop in salary, for the current market place. It isn’t that people don’t “want” to hire a Sr. .Net Developer, they don’t have the budget to hire them right now.</p>  <p>I have to admit, it is getting a bit tiresome, hopefully soon it will pick up, at least it better, the bank accounts are draining pretty fast.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2184" width="1" height="1">
