<p>So, long time no news eh?</p>  <p>It has been a pretty eventful/uneventful last couple of weeks for me, I have been doing some testing and interviewing for the same company that I did last time, for a different position this time, a bit more challenging, but I am quite excited. I have yet to hear back on my test results yet, but hopefully early next week I will hear something.</p>  <p>On the other end, the test that I took really brought out some things I want to do some development articles on, as I finish them I will update this post, but for now, here is the list.</p>  <ul>   <li>Non-Confusing Localization with WPF using standard resource files. (WPF standard not fun)</li>    <li>Easy to use Unity Framework for Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IOC)</li>    <li>MVP design pattern with WPF – the easy way</li> </ul>  <p>These are just a few that I had an idea for, hopefully you will find them interesting, as well as find some “tweaks” that I had to do during this process, that were a bit annoying, useful for the lack of a mature designer for XAML (Blend and Visual Studio still have some… issues).</p>  <p>Anyway, look for these articles tonight, as I feel like I am in a writing mood.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2195" width="1" height="1">
