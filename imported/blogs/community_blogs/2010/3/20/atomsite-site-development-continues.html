<p>So, a while back I had mentioned something about creating a site for <a href="http://tomanderson.me" target="_blank">TomAnderson.me</a>.</p>  <p>Originally I was going to write the entire thing from scratch, then release the source, etc… Well, life happens, I don’t have that kind of time, and I want to “get in an code”.</p>  <p>I am going to check out the <a href="http://atomsite.net/" target="_blank">Atom Site</a> open source project for ASP.Net MVC and see how I like it, who knows, I might actually get the site up and running in the next few years.</p>  <p>Anyway, off to the races!</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2319" width="1" height="1">
