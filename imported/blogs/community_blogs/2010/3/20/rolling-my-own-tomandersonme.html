<p>Well, that’s it.</p>  <p>I am just going to roll my own, what better way to learn, than to do (paraphrased from “<em>The only source of knowledge is experience.”</em>&#160; by <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/a/albert_einstein_8.html" target="_blank">Albert Einstein</a>).</p>  <p>I have installed <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.Net MVC 2</a>, and am downloading <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/dd582936.aspx" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2010 Premium RC</a> (which luckily has a “go live” license attached to it).&#160; This will allow me to utilize not only the newest in <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.Net MVC</a>, but also start working on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/dd582936.aspx" target="_blank">.Net 4.0</a>, which is another one of my goals.</p>  <p>So for today, I want to get the project started up, separate out the projects in the specific <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank">concerns</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/07/31/asp-net-mvc-v2-preview-1-released.aspx" target="_blank">areas</a>, as well as stripping out any sort of Windows Authentication/Forms Authentication in a traditional ASP.Net fashion for the wonderfulness of <a href="http://openid.net/" target="_blank">OpenId</a>.</p>  <p>Once I have the site structure, as well as the logins, I want to start working on the base master page. For now I will most likely style it after a cleaned up version of the current <a href="http://tomanderson.me/" target="_blank">TomAnderson.me</a> – I like the colors, but obviously for copyright reasons, I will have to make some adjustments and roll my own images for the site.</p>  <p>Because my hosting does not yet support .Net 4.0 (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/dd582936.aspx" target="_blank">because it is an RC</a>) I won’t be able to get live updates until they do, but I plan on posting it up to a <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">codeplex</a> or <a href="http://code.google.com/" target="_blank">Google code</a> project for anyone to enjoy and comment on, all feedback is welcome.</p>  <p>The first iterations are going to be very strongly about getting some of the things I want to do fleshed out (site.com/sandbox/blah) most likely, and then re-<a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/archive/2009/07/03/website-journal-part-3-scouring-the-web-for-ideas.aspx" target="_blank">identifying things I like across the web</a>, and figuring out how to implement them, either on the client, or the server.</p>  <p>Well, while I download the 2.2gb of Visual Studio 2010, I will be creating the directory structure and the hosted source control, will update when those are available.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2321" width="1" height="1">
