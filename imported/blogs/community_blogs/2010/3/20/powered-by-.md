Some fun facts:

* I am always listening to [Pandora][1]. My stations include Chevelle (new rock), White Zombie (older metal), Clint Mansell (soundtracks/classical), and Paul Oakenfold (techno – [Does the music frighten you][2]?) all with a lot of additions to them and listen to each depending on my mood.
* For late nights I drink [AMP energy drinks][3] to keep me going – prefer Traction (purple) but try to drink more of the sugar free.
* [Windows Live Writer][4] powers my blog posts.
* I use [Photoshop CS 4 Master Suite][5] for image editing (and more).
* For screen shots and quick note taking, I use [OneNote 2007][6] with some serious anxiety for [OneNote 2010][7].
* I am part of the [three monitor club][8] using 2 video cards, not any repeaters.
* I run [Windows 7 Ultimate Signature Edition][9].
* So yes, I "hosted" a [Windows 7 Launch Party][10].

Anyway, this will probably go on my about page for [TomAnderson.me][11], just bored still waiting for Visual Studio 2010 to download.
