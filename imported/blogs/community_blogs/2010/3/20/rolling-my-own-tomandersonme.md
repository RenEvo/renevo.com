Well, that's it.

I am just going to roll my own, what better way to learn, than to do (paraphrased from "_The only source of knowledge is experience."_  by [Albert Einstein][1]).

I have installed [ASP.Net MVC 2][2], and am downloading [Visual Studio 2010 Premium RC][3] (which luckily has a "go live" license attached to it).  This will allow me to utilize not only the newest in [ASP.Net MVC][2], but also start working on [.Net 4.0][3], which is another one of my goals.

So for today, I want to get the project started up, separate out the projects in the specific [concerns][4] and [areas][5], as well as stripping out any sort of Windows Authentication/Forms Authentication in a traditional ASP.Net fashion for the wonderfulness of [OpenId][6].

Once I have the site structure, as well as the logins, I want to start working on the base master page. For now I will most likely style it after a cleaned up version of the current [TomAnderson.me][7] – I like the colors, but obviously for copyright reasons, I will have to make some adjustments and roll my own images for the site.

Because my hosting does not yet support .Net 4.0 ([because it is an RC][3]) I won't be able to get live updates until they do, but I plan on posting it up to a [codeplex][8] or [Google code][9] project for anyone to enjoy and comment on, all feedback is welcome.

The first iterations are going to be very strongly about getting some of the things I want to do fleshed out (site.com/sandbox/blah) most likely, and then re-[identifying things I like across the web][10], and figuring out how to implement them, either on the client, or the server.

Well, while I download the 2.2gb of Visual Studio 2010, I will be creating the directory structure and the hosted source control, will update when those are available.
