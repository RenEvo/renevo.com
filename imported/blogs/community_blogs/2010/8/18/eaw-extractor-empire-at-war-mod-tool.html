<p>So, the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=EAW+EXTRACTOR" target="_blank">EAW Extractor</a>, for <a href="http://petroglyphgames.com/game?id=2" target="_blank">Empire At War by Petroglyph</a>, was a bit more popular than I had recently realized.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.renevo.com/files/folders/eaw/entry131.aspx"><img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;display:inline;border-top:0px;border-right:0px;" title="eawextractor" border="0" alt="eawextractor" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/EAWExtractorEmpireAtWarmodtool_1477D/eawextractor.png" width="644" height="137" /></a> </p>  <p>Not to shabby.</p>  <p>With the recent release of <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/32470" target="_blank">Empire At War on Steam</a>, I think I will probably fish out this old code and make sure it is compatible with it and do a “refresh” of the code base. Maybe even play with the UI a bit, been looking for something “old” to work on, just have to clear it with the legal department at work.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2361" width="1" height="1">
