Just letting everyone know (and as a reminder to myself) that during this week I plan on restructuring the top links a bit, as well as adding some "landing pages" for each section.

The new proposed layout will be:

* Home
* Products
    * Game Tools
    * Wiisis
    * Command & Crysis: The Dead Six
    * Archived Projects
* Community
    * Dashboard
    * Blogs
    * Media
    * Forums
    * Affiliates
* Downloads
* About

Some other site enhancements will be done as well.

* Add link to RenEvo Dead Six Forums for people to talk about the mod and ask questions (dead6.renevo.com)
* Enable [PicLens][1] support for both RenEvo and Dead Six web sites (home page support)
* Change the way that the front page displays recent blog posts, changing to display last 5 full posts, instead of 5 summaries.
* Add an affiliate registration process, so other sites can link-exchange (must be a registered user of this site).
* Provide banners and image buttons for link-exchange.
* Add some snazzy graphics on the right side of the home page, instead of static links to sub-sections (dead six, wiisis, etc...)
