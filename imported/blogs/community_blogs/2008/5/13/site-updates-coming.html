<p>Just letting everyone know (and as a reminder to myself) that during this week I plan on restructuring the top links a bit, as well as adding some &quot;landing pages&quot; for each section.</p>  <p>The new proposed layout will be:</p>  <ul>   <li>Home</li>    <li>Products</li>    <ul>     <li>Game Tools</li>      <li>Wiisis</li>      <li>Command &amp; Crysis: The Dead Six</li>      <li>Archived Projects</li>   </ul>    <li>Community</li>    <ul>     <li>Dashboard</li>      <li>Blogs</li>      <li>Media</li>      <li>Forums</li>      <li>Affiliates</li>   </ul>    <li>Downloads</li>    <li>About</li> </ul>  <p>Some other site enhancements will be done as well.</p>  <ul>   <li>Add link to RenEvo Dead Six Forums for people to talk about the mod and ask questions (dead6.renevo.com)</li>    <li>Enable <a href="http://www.piclens.com/" target="_blank">PicLens</a> support for both RenEvo and Dead Six web sites (home page support)</li>    <li>Change the way that the front page displays recent blog posts, changing to display last 5 full posts, instead of 5 summaries.</li>    <li>Add an affiliate registration process, so other sites can link-exchange (must be a registered user of this site).</li>    <li>Provide banners and image buttons for link-exchange.</li>    <li>Add some snazzy graphics on the right side of the home page, instead of static links to sub-sections (dead six, wiisis, etc...)</li> </ul><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1904" width="1" height="1">
