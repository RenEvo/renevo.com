<p>I am not much of a Star Trek nerd, I will admit it.&#160; I am more of a Star Wars kind of guy, just not an “uber” geek.</p>  <p>Anyway, the new Star Trek movie kind of has me excited. For those that have been under a rock, it is basically a complete reboot of the franchise, meaning they redid the entire concept using just the idea and names of the original series. You can find the trailer at <a href="http://www.startrekmovie.com">http://www.startrekmovie.com</a></p>  <p>One thing I did notice though, is the very Star Wars cop that is in the intro of the 2nd trailer, for some reason, I really dig this helmet.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.startrekmovie.com"><img title="image" style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;display:inline;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="276" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_3BEB26C4.png" width="644" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Which is why, it has become my new avatar.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.renevo.com/user/Profile.aspx?UserID=2100"><img title="image" style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;display:inline;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="122" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_1F735646.png" width="122" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p>I used paths to draw around the image, and then created a layer mask based on the path.&#160; Simple enough.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2088" width="1" height="1">
