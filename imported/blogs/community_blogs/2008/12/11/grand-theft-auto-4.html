I haven’t really played many of the previous Grand Theft Auto games, but this one I picked up at Blockbuster to rent, and have since put it on my Christmas list for the wife to buy me!</p>  <p>I like sandbox games, I can either do the missions in any order that I want, or turn off the phone (which is required to not get negative ratings on people calling you to hang out) and go cause some mayhem around “Liberty City”, a.k.a. a really good New York knock off.</p>  <p>If you feel the need to play some multi-player, add me as a friend on the Playstation Network, my name is “Denate”.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2104" width="1" height="1">
