[DCOM Productions][1] has underwent a bit of a site overhaul, including moving their domain name, as well as upgrading the visual consistency of the site.

![image][2]

Some of the changes that took place are:

> **Global**   
\- Domain DCOMPRODUCTIONS.NET has been permanently moved to DCOMPRODUCTIONS.COM   
\- Domain DCOMPRODUCTIONS.COM is now the primary domain.   
\- Logo was redesigned   
\- Name changed from DCOM Productions .NET, back to DCOM Productions for professionalism.   
**Website**   
\- Style completely redone according to the Windows Vista developer guidelines. Colors, font sizes, etc. are now corrected.   
\- Blogs, and all other unneeded pages were removed. Blogs will shortly be resumed over at our partner site, RenEvo.   
\- Downloads have been reorganized for better accessibility.   
**Forums**   
\- Users can now upload, link-to, and use their own avatars.   
\- Group management controls have been fixed.   
\- Maximum signature length lifted from 150 characters to 225 characters.

Remind me to get [Dave][3] a spell checker for posting news!
