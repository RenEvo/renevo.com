RenEvo Software & Designs is proud to announce it's first partner community, [DCOM Productions .Net][2] or DPDN. With the commonality of our websites, it is only logical to partner with them.

> _DPDN is a software development "business", though not officially. We develop what we think is cool, what we desire. We have made a few products for a few games out there and also a few utilities, and other cool programs. We hope to continue to make great software that we can share with the world. Though I venture to say we just do software development, I also do web development on my part. Locally I make and help people deploy websites for their own use._

Dave Anderson is a colleague of mine who my company is contracting to do some work with our financial integration software.Â  Dave is quite a bright guy and hopefully our company will be able to snag him up full time and move him out to sunny California.

As a partner, we will be cross posting news, as well as more involved partnerships with our software products, as well as our blogs.

Come back soon for more information on this partnership as the details are worked out! I am very excited about this partnership.
