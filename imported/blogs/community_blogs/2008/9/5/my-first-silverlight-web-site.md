After playing around a bit, it looks like I will be creating the <http://www.stofma.com> web site with Silverlight and C#.  This will be new territory for me, but honestly, it is way easier than dealing with flash.  The requirements of the web site is to have a single page that has an animated header capable of playing mp3's as well as changing the content of the page via AJAX all on an Apache web server.  With Silverlight I will be able to accomplish all of this without some serious Java Script linkage between Action Script and Html.

As I get the site updated, I will post here with updates. The goal is to have a landing page by Monday for the CD release on Tuesday.  The extra functionality will come quickly there after to have quite a few pages.

Some other technology additions that I will be using for this site is using <http://www.renevo.com> as the data warehouse for updating the pages and news via a custom Word press implementation in ASP.Net for Windows Live Writer and web services to server the data to the Apache web site.  This will enable the band to open and edit pages directly from inside of Windows Live Writer, as well as add, edit, and delete news and blog entries.  Most likely the source code for the server side component will be released on <http://www.renevo.com>, as well as a sample implementation in Silverlight on how to use the data and web services.

Wish me luck, this is a very current technology web site, and will really allow me to use a lot of things that I have learned over the last few years.
