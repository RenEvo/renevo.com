<p>After playing around a bit, it looks like I will be creating the <a href="http://www.stofma.com">http://www.stofma.com</a> web site with Silverlight and C#.&#160; This will be new territory for me, but honestly, it is way easier than dealing with flash.&#160; The requirements of the web site is to have a single page that has an animated header capable of playing mp3's as well as changing the content of the page via AJAX all on an Apache web server.&#160; With Silverlight I will be able to accomplish all of this without some serious Java Script linkage between Action Script and Html.</p>  <p>As I get the site updated, I will post here with updates. The goal is to have a landing page by Monday for the CD release on Tuesday.&#160; The extra functionality will come quickly there after to have quite a few pages.</p>  <p>Some other technology additions that I will be using for this site is using <a href="http://www.renevo.com">http://www.renevo.com</a> as the data warehouse for updating the pages and news via a custom Word press implementation in ASP.Net for Windows Live Writer and web services to server the data to the Apache web site.&#160; This will enable the band to open and edit pages directly from inside of Windows Live Writer, as well as add, edit, and delete news and blog entries.&#160; Most likely the source code for the server side component will be released on <a href="http://www.renevo.com">http://www.renevo.com</a>, as well as a sample implementation in Silverlight on how to use the data and web services.</p>  <p>Wish me luck, this is a very current technology web site, and will really allow me to use a lot of things that I have learned over the last few years.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2017" width="1" height="1">
