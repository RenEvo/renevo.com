This will help you share your vision with the communities, and specifically, with anyone crazy enough to join you on that trip of making a very selfish game based on your ideas.</p>  <p>RenEvo is not going anywhere, I still plan on keeping it up for support of Wiisis and other old projects, as well as my programming blog, but currently there are no big projects that need to be announced from RenEvo.</p>  <p>The source code for the project as well as the resources for the mod will most likely be released (all versions we still have) at a later date, for people to play around with.</p>  <p>Again, thanks to everyone who ever helped or supported this mod and my vain attempt at making &quot;my&quot; perfect game.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1945" width="1" height="1">
