Figuratively speaking, the Dead Six has almost always been a mod of dead activity.  Early back in the humble beginnings of the mod, it was planned as an expansion to the Single Player campaign for C&C Renegade that would allow you to play more with the characters somewhat introduced in the last half of the game.  First called "Renegade X".

The Dead Six has literally moved through 4 game engines, and has little to show except a huge chunk of programming done on those 4 game engines, some concept art, and a handful of models made for those different engines.  W3D engine, Source Engine, CryEngine 1, and finally CryEngine 2.

I would like to take the time to thank everyone that ever supported the mod, as well as any past members of the mod.  It was my honor to work with you all and have you help me try to make a game that only lived in my head.  I blame no one but myself for the failure of this mod, and I expect to hear all of the banters of "i told you so" and "and?" responses across anywhere this may be posted.

If I was to give one piece of advice to anyone wanting to start a new mod, especially a Total Conversion, be sure you know what you are getting into, what you want to make, and make lots of notes on what you want, because not everyone can read your mind. This will help you share your vision with the communities, and specifically, with anyone crazy enough to join you on that trip of making a very selfish game based on your ideas.

RenEvo is not going anywhere, I still plan on keeping it up for support of Wiisis and other old projects, as well as my programming blog, but currently there are no big projects that need to be announced from RenEvo.

The source code for the project as well as the resources for the mod will most likely be released (all versions we still have) at a later date, for people to play around with.

Again, thanks to everyone who ever helped or supported this mod and my vain attempt at making "my" perfect game.
