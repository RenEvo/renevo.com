<p>Here for the last few months I have been rewriting a vb6 application into 100% .Net and upgrading a web site from .Net 1.1 to .Net 2.0.&#160; This system is one of our feature products where I work.</p>  <p><strong><em>NorthStar Recipe Viewer</em></strong></p>  <p><em>The NorthStar Recipe System was designed to give recipe administrators the ability to centrally manage recipes and cooking procedures in a stable, user friendly environment. Recipes are centrally managed and disseminated via a web based portal, which allows multi-unit chains the ability to edit and update any recipe company wide with the push of a button.&#160; The Recipe Editor program makes it easy for users to embed pictures and multimedia into recipes.&#160; Streaming video allows companies to truly demonstrate your cooking procedures and other training, such as quality of service and safety programs.&#160; </em></p>  <p><em>The Recipe Editor software allows a single user or groups of users to create, edit, and delete recipes quickly and simultaneously.&#160; Users can access the database from different workstations at the same time, and an entire recipe collection can be created within days.&#160; Recipes can then be added, modified, or put into practice immediately; and every unit within the organization can be notified of the change within seconds.</em></p>  <p>The application consists of two parts, the front end of the system is a portal based web application that is geared for kiosk touch screen terminals.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/tootingmyownhornabit_9385/image_2.png"><img style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="175" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/tootingmyownhornabit_9385/image_thumb.png" width="244" border="0" /></a>&#160; <a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/tootingmyownhornabit_9385/image_4.png"><img style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="215" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/tootingmyownhornabit_9385/image_thumb_1.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/tootingmyownhornabit_9385/image_6.png"><img style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="215" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/tootingmyownhornabit_9385/image_thumb_2.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>One of the requirements for the application was to have a WYSIWYG editor for the Recipes. In the screen shots below, you will see the actual Recipe editor, which is as close to WYSIWYG as I could get in the first rev.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/tootingmyownhornabit_9385/image_8.png"><img style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="152" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/tootingmyownhornabit_9385/image_thumb_3.png" width="244" border="0" /></a>&#160;<a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/tootingmyownhornabit_9385/image_10.png"><img style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="167" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/tootingmyownhornabit_9385/image_thumb_4.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/tootingmyownhornabit_9385/image_12.png"><img style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="194" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/tootingmyownhornabit_9385/image_thumb_5.png" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>The application was a lot of fun to develop, and still has quite a ways to go until it is fully released, but from the screen shots above and the description, you get a general idea of what I have been working on for the last couple months.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.northstarenterprise.com/Home/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=226" target="_blank">More Information</a></p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1936" width="1" height="1">
