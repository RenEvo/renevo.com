Here for the last few months I have been rewriting a vb6 application into 100% .Net and upgrading a web site from .Net 1.1 to .Net 2.0.  This system is one of our feature products where I work.

**_NorthStar Recipe Viewer_**

_The NorthStar Recipe System was designed to give recipe administrators the ability to centrally manage recipes and cooking procedures in a stable, user friendly environment. Recipes are centrally managed and disseminated via a web based portal, which allows multi-unit chains the ability to edit and update any recipe company wide with the push of a button.  The Recipe Editor program makes it easy for users to embed pictures and multimedia into recipes.  Streaming video allows companies to truly demonstrate your cooking procedures and other training, such as quality of service and safety programs.  _

_The Recipe Editor software allows a single user or groups of users to create, edit, and delete recipes quickly and simultaneously.  Users can access the database from different workstations at the same time, and an entire recipe collection can be created within days.  Recipes can then be added, modified, or put into practice immediately; and every unit within the organization can be notified of the change within seconds._

The application consists of two parts, the front end of the system is a portal based web application that is geared for kiosk touch screen terminals.

One of the requirements for the application was to have a WYSIWYG editor for the Recipes. In the screen shots below, you will see the actual Recipe editor, which is as close to WYSIWYG as I could get in the first rev.

The application was a lot of fun to develop, and still has quite a ways to go until it is fully released, but from the screen shots above and the description, you get a general idea of what I have been working on for the last couple months.
