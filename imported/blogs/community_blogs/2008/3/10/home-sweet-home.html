<p>So, in case some of you did not know, or read any previous blogs, I am in the final process of purchasing a new house and should be getting the keys on Wednesday to move in!</p>  <p>Here is a picture of my new home, in Orange California.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/HomeSweetHome_BBBB/DSC00198.jpg"><img style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="484" alt="DSC00198" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/WindowsLiveWriter/HomeSweetHome_BBBB/DSC00198_thumb.jpg" width="644" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>So, needless to say, I do have my Sprint Card for my laptop, but I may be offline for a few days during the move.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1792" width="1" height="1">
