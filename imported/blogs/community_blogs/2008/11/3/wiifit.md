So last week was my wife's birthday, she had been wanting a Wii forever, and finally I picked one up for her.Â  The WiiFit has been a nightmare to try to find in stores, but we finally got lucky yesterday. After the huge amount of setup time to get it all configured for your body, balance, and setup some goals; it was actually a lot of fun for a video game designed to get your big butt smaller. Me and the wife both set goals for ourselves, we are actually having a little competition to see who meets their one month goals.

After seeing how this board actually works, I think adding support to it for Wiisis might just be really fun, just got to get it hooked up to the Wiisis driver framework and find out what kind of feedback we are getting from it, but look forward to the possibility of some WiiFit integration for Wiisis!
