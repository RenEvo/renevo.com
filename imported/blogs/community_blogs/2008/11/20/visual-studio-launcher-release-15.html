<p><a href="http://www.dcomproductions.net/" target="_blank">DCOM Productions</a> has released a new version of the Visual Studio Launcher.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://www.dcomproductions.com/index.php?page=downloads&amp;product=vsl" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="http://downloads.dcomproductions.com/vsl/images/splash1.5.png" border="0" /></a></p>    <p>     <br /><em>Release 1.5 is finally here after many internal code changes, feature additions, testing and builds. The new version features include a fully automated update process that will keep your application up to date, as well as the ability to add process and file shortcuts to your developer menu. The settings screen has been redesigned to match the Visual Studio options screen format, and has had some new options added.        <br />As always, you can grab the new version from our </em><a href="http://www.dcomproductions.net/index.php?page=downloads&amp;product=vsl"><em>downloads page</em></a><em>, or via </em><a href="http://downloads.dcomproductions.net/vsl/1.5/vsl.zip"><em>direct link here</em></a><em>.</em></p> </blockquote>  <p>This is a great program that I personally use quite often, not to mention I am one of the supporting developers on the project.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2081" width="1" height="1">
