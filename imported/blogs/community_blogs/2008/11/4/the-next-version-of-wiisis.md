So some time on my end has become freed up, and I have decided that the Wiisis project could use a few more features.

We have two major features that we are thinking about adding to Wiisis, and we wanted to get the communities feedback on which feature to build first.

**WiiFit Support   
![][2]**

The idea behind WiiFit support would be for movement driven by the balance board, simply stand on the board and your character will move depending on your offset to center.  If you slightly lean forward, your character will slowly move forward, if you lean hard forward your character would run forward, etc…

**Head Tracking with a Second Wiimote   
**Everyone knows what head tracking is, basically you have a Wiimote pointed at your head while you wear a special set of glasses with IR lights on it, as you move your head your point of view in the game is adjusted as per your head movements.

Let your votes count, head over to [RenEvo Software & Designs user voice page][3] and cast your votes!
