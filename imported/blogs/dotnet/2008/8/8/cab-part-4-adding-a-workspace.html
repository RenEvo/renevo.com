<p>In the <a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/dotnet/archive/tags/CAB/default.aspx" target="_blank">previous articles on CAB</a> we have gone over creating the basics with a CAB, right now our application really has no &quot;Composite&quot; to it, just &quot;Application Block&quot;.&#160; In this article we will go over creating our first WorkSpace for modules to dock into, which will lead us to our next article on creating a basic module with a single workspace.</p>  <p>The first thing we need to do, in order to work with the CAB WinForms controls, is to create a new Tab on our Forms Toolbox, and load up the Microsoft.Practices.CompositeUI.WinForms.dll controls to it.&#160; If you need help on this, you can see many articles on the web on how to add items to your toolbox, like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165355(VS.80).aspx" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p>  <p>You should now have 7 new controls, the one we are going to concentrate on for this article is the DeckWorkspace.&#160; Simply drag it onto our form, set the Dock to Fill, name it uxPrimaryWorkspace, then clear the Text property.</p>  <p>Your form in designer should look like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/dotnet/WindowsLiveWriter/CABPart3AddingaWorkSpace_C821/image_2.png"><img style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="173" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/dotnet/WindowsLiveWriter/CABPart3AddingaWorkSpace_C821/image_thumb.png" width="240" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>The size of the form is un-important, later we will go about saving the forms settings, etc... but for now, lets leave it as is.</p>  <p>Now that we have our form setup, we need to add some ways to access this workspace, as well as register the WorkSpace with the CAB framework.&#160; This is usually done via id strings, but since we want our users to properly access this workspace, we will want to create constants for access.&#160; Instead of the modules accessing and referencing the main executable, we will add another project with the name &quot;.Interfaces&quot; that will contain all the constants for extension sites, workspaces, as well as internal services.</p>  <p>Add a Class Library project to the solution named &quot;RenEvo.Blogs.Cab.Interfaces&quot; with the default directory specified.&#160; Next delete the Class1.vb that is automaticaly created.</p>  <p>Create a new folder called Common, then a new class file inside of that folder called WorkSpaces.&#160; In the class file you need to implement a namespace, as well as a few constants inside of the class.&#160; The namespace is only for better organization, and separation of objects.</p>  <div class="csharpcode">   <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   1:  </span><span class="kwrd">Namespace</span> Common.Constants</pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">   2:  </span>&#160;</pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   3:  </span>    <span class="rem">''' &lt;summary&gt;</span></pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">   4:  </span>    <span class="rem">''' Class to store all of the workspace names</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   5:  </span>    <span class="rem">''' &lt;/summary&gt;</span></pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">   6:  </span>    <span class="kwrd">Public</span> <span class="kwrd">Class</span> WorkSpaces</pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   7:  </span>        <span class="rem">''' &lt;summary&gt;</span></pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">   8:  </span>        <span class="rem">''' The Primary Workspace for the CAB application</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   9:  </span>        <span class="rem">''' &lt;/summary&gt;</span></pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">  10:  </span>        <span class="kwrd">Public</span> <span class="kwrd">Const</span> PrimaryWorkSpace <span class="kwrd">As</span> <span class="kwrd">String</span> = <span class="str">&quot;PrimaryWorkSpace&quot;</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">  11:  </span>&#160;</pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">  12:  </span>    <span class="kwrd">End</span> <span class="kwrd">Class</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">  13:  </span>&#160;</pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">  14:  </span><span class="kwrd">End</span> Namespace</pre>
</div>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>For now our class really doesn't cover a lot of constants, but in a larger application this could get quite huge.&#160; Plus we no longer will have casing or mis-spelling issues with the other developers.</p>

<p>Now add a reference to the new project to the main Shell project, setting the copy to True.</p>

<p>Next, back in our form, we need to access the Constructor, and after the InitializeComponent, we want to reset the name of the uxPrimaryWorkspace in runtime to the name of the string in the preceding class.</p>

<div class="csharpcode">
  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   1:  </span>    <span class="kwrd">Public</span> <span class="kwrd">Sub</span> <span class="kwrd">New</span>()</pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">   2:  </span>&#160;</pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   3:  </span>        <span class="rem">' This call is required by the Windows Form Designer.</span></pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">   4:  </span>        InitializeComponent()</pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   5:  </span>&#160;</pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">   6:  </span>        <span class="rem">' Add any initialization after the InitializeComponent() call.</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   7:  </span>        <span class="kwrd">Me</span>.uxPrimaryWorkspace.Name = Interfaces.Common.Constants.WorkSpaces.PrimaryWorkSpace</pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">   8:  </span>&#160;</pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   9:  </span>    <span class="kwrd">End</span> Sub</pre>
</div>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>This is a really easy implementation, probably the easiest in the entire application.&#160; To test it, we can do the following in our Startup.vb class.</p>

<p>In the ShellShown event handlers, add the following lines of code to the bottom of the method.</p>

<div class="csharpcode">
  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   1:  </span>    <span class="kwrd">Protected</span> <span class="kwrd">Sub</span> ShellShown(<span class="kwrd">ByVal</span> sender <span class="kwrd">As</span> <span class="kwrd">Object</span>, <span class="kwrd">ByVal</span> e <span class="kwrd">As</span> EventArgs)</pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">   2:  </span>        <span class="rem">'remove the handler</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   3:  </span>        <span class="kwrd">RemoveHandler</span> Shell.Shown, <span class="kwrd">AddressOf</span> ShellShown</pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">   4:  </span>&#160;</pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   5:  </span>        <span class="rem">'set the cursor back to normal</span></pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">   6:  </span>        m_Splash.Cursor = Cursors.<span class="kwrd">Default</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   7:  </span>&#160;</pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">   8:  </span>        <span class="rem">'hide, dispose, and kill the splash </span></pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">   9:  </span>        m_Splash.Hide()</pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">  10:  </span>        m_Splash.Dispose()</pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">  11:  </span>        m_Splash = <span class="kwrd">Nothing</span></pre>

  <pre><span class="lnum">  12:  </span>&#160;</pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">  13:  </span>        <span class="rem">'test to see if we have a workspace</span></pre>

  <pre><strong><span class="lnum">  14:  </span>        MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">&quot;Workspace Initialized: &quot;</span> &amp; <span class="kwrd">Boolean</span>.Parse(<span class="kwrd">Me</span>.RootWorkItem.Workspaces(Interfaces.Common.Constants.WorkSpaces.PrimaryWorkSpace) IsNot <span class="kwrd">Nothing</span>))</strong></pre>

  <pre class="alt"><span class="lnum">  15:  </span>    <span class="kwrd">End</span> Sub</pre>
</div>

<p>When ran, the application will display &quot;Workspace Initialized: True&quot; in a message box just after the splash screen closes.</p>

<p>Now remove that line of code, as we don't want that message box to continue displaying.</p>

<p>As stated before, in the next article I will be covering the creation of a very simplistic module that will load into this newly created workspace.</p>
