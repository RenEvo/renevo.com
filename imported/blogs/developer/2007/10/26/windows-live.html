<P>Originally some time last year when Windows Live started getting all of this attention, I was drawn in being a Microsoft Junkie and all.&nbsp; Windows Live Messenger, OneCare, Live Writer, Hotmail Live, I was googie over them all.</P>
<P>Then, came the dreaded "You can not install this program on that operating system".</P>
<P>Lets back up a bit... As soon as Vista went RTM, I installed it, see above about how much of a Microsoft Junkie I am. Having a Dual Dual Core Opterons, installing Vista 64 bit seemed the obvious choice, so that I could take advantage of the extra processing capabilities of the 64 bit and cpus.&nbsp; First message I get when installing all of my old software "Windows OneCare cannot run on this operating system.".&nbsp; Are you kidding me?&nbsp; A Microsoft Product not working on a brand new Operating System, specifically a <STRONG>brand new</STRONG> anti-virus system built <STRONG>for</STRONG> windows? So, I resorted to installing Avast, which seemed at the time to be the only 64 bit capable Vista anti-virus.</P>
<P>Now, lets move forward to today... Once again, I got an itch to try out the Windows Live Writer, I must admit that I had been a bit lazy at posting to this blog, so I thought I would get back on track.&nbsp; I head over to live spaces to pick up the newest Beta for Windows Live Writer to get the same message I got with OneCare. "You cannot install this program on this operating system".</P>
<P>Ok, lets look at this logically, and with a bit of thought.</P>
<P>Windows Live Writer is a .Net 2.0 application, most likely written in C#. I am a .Net 2.0 Developer that works in Vista Ultimate 64. Why the hell can't this "special" .Net 2.0 program run in Vista 64?&nbsp; The .Net framework manages the mode (be-it 32 or 64 bit) when the program is JIT (Just In Time) Compiled from the IL (Intermediate Language).&nbsp; So what the hell?&nbsp; Even then, if they noticed some problems with the JIT, why couldn't they have just specified x86 mode, instead of "AnyCpu" configuration on compile?&nbsp; I am currently developing an x86 compiled application right now that I have 0 problems running, debugging, and building on x64.</P>
<P>I am getting a bit "iffy" about this whole Microsoft's direction with "Live", whats next, the newest patch to Windows Live Messenger won't run on x64?&nbsp; Now that would be a killer, considering I use Live Messenger for communicating with co-workers on and off site.&nbsp; When will Microsoft understand that x64 is a mainstream operating system, and they need to get thier apps up to thier own "Microsoft Certified Application" specifications</P>
<P><EM>Application must run in both 32 and 64 bit modes</EM></P>
<P>Anyway, Enough about live, lets see how my registration for "Live Custom Domains" goes, still have no idea what the hell it is, but it has an SDK, and I had a free domain name to play with.</P>
