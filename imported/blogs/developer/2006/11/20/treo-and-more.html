<p>So, i just recently picked up a Treo 700wx, and I must admit, at first it was a tad overwhelming.&nbsp; Features, features, features.&nbsp; After about 2 hours of playing with it though, I am finally pleased with it, and have started customizing everything.&nbsp; And... I have joined the bluetooth frontier.&nbsp; I have been reluctant for some unknown reason to join the bluetooth frontier, but after purchasing this phone I had to get the headset for it.&nbsp; Also, in July 2008 California goes mandatory hands free mode on the phone while driving.&nbsp; If you can afford the $700 cost of buying it, I heavily recommend picking one up.</p> <p>I uploaded a bunch of pics and files to the site this weekend, having some issues with the 3ds max W3D importer, but I will get that resolved and posted soon.&nbsp; Also I plan on posting up vloktboky's source code stuff this week as well, they are slightly larger files so it will take me a bit more time to get them uploaded. I sometimes forget a lot of the stuff that I have done over the years of running this site, some of it was pretty comical, others pretty shocking.&nbsp; If you haven't seen what RenEvo has done, you should check out the downloads section for a bit of an insight into the past of what is available.</p> <p>This week is a toughie for me, I am building a database versioning system for work and need to get it going pretty fast on it as well as get it completed, hopefully I will have time to work on SWGEmuDotNet and get the first build out for developers to start tinkering with.&nbsp; If not, I plan on getting some major work done this weekend on it anyway.</p> <p>Some serious staff hiring is going on for C&amp;C FarCry and The Dead 6 right now, since they are very similiar projects by gameplay, we can hire staff for both, which is nice, and even some of the items we create can be merged over.&nbsp;We just picked up another modeler and mapper for sure, Oggy and Gypsy, they come from FarmCry a mod for FarCry, it looks pretty interesting, it is a totally different type of mod.&nbsp; We should be able to reach our beta release finally, which excites me to no end, I really want the community to start playing this mod (C&amp;C FarCry).&nbsp; Its entertaining, and brings C&amp;C mode to another game on a newer engine then Renegade.&nbsp;Although I think like most other MP mods for FarCry that the Ubisoft server stuff will prove to be a pain, we will do our best to help people out who are having issues getting connected to servers.</p> <p>And finally, some more work is going on with tweaking the final bits of The Dead 6, we are fixing and verifying some of the story bits, and are working with some people to get us some tools to start working on the mod for real.&nbsp;You may see a news announcement about this quite soon!</p> <p>Thats pretty much it for today, I gotta get back to work, and wait on this damned udpate script to finish executing.&nbsp;I knew the first update would be painful, but it is already 20 minutes into the update, and no sign of hope just yet.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=173" width="1" height="1">
