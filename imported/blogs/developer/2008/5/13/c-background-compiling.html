<p>With Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (now in beta), C# gets one of those huge features that turned me off to the language in the first place, Background Compiling!</p>  <p><em>What does this mean???</em></p>  <p>Simply put, when you type in an error in the code, you know about it without having to compile, for example.   <br /><img height="380" src="http://codebetter.com/photos/david.hayden/images/178161/original.aspx" width="469" /></p>  <p>Product is an invalid object, so therefore it gets a red squiggly without compiling, which is a huge step.</p>  <p>Another example:   <br /><img height="382" src="http://codebetter.com/photos/david.hayden/images/178163/original.aspx" width="490" /></p>  <p>Wrong return types, which is nice.</p>  <p>This feature alone will probably get me into C# a lot faster then I was originally planning, this is what dynamic spell checking did for Microsoft Word in my opinion.</p>  <p>Great feature add, and I can't wait for the &quot;official&quot; release of .Net 3.5 SP 1 as well as Visual Studio 2008 SP 1.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1903" width="1" height="1">
