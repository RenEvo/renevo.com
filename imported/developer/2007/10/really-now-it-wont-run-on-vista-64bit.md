Well, I decided, what the hey right?

I downloaded and installed the [Windows Live Writer Beta 3][1], installed it on a Virtual PC (Windows XP SP2 32bit), then simply copied over the C:Program FilesWindows LiveWriter folder that it created to my C: Drive, opened it up, and to my total surprise, and expectation, it works fine.  This operating system blocking for installers of .Net applications is just comical if you ask me.  The entire point of the .Net framework was to create an Operating System Agnostic development environment for developers without having to worry about 32bit vs. 64bit especially.  That is the wonderment of compiling to "AnyCpu".

Oh what's that, That is this blog post running on Vista 64 in Windows Live Writer Beta 3.  Silly installers...

On some other notes, I downloaded and played around with the [Crysis Single Player Demo][3] that released on Friday. To my dismay, my [nVidia Quadro FX 3500][4] is incapable of running Crysis, I get all kinds of funky issues, such as objects not rendering (invisible), and only being able to see shaders, terrain, and shadows.  Let me tell you, that opening sequence inside of the cargo bay of the plane is quite wierd looking with floating eyes. I tried installing an 8500GT, the bonus was that it has 512 memory and DX10 support, the bad part was that it dropped my Vista score from 5.9 to 4.7, as well as every other game I play completely sucked and I had to turn everything down.  So, needless to say, I returned the 8500GT and put my Quadro back in.  I don't want to sacrifice a $1000 high-end card to play a $50 game, no matter how cool it is.  Hopefully Crytek hears my cries and will help me get it fixed, otherwise my own mods are in jeopardy of me helping, as I can't even run the game engine we are developing on.

And finally, Yes, I was one of those geek's on Saturday night waiting out in front of GameStop to pick up Guitar Hero 3 for PS3.  I haven't had much time to play it yet, except the hour after I got home from picking it up. So far my opinions on it are that it is much better and responsive then the Guitar Hero 2, and even the note sequencing is a lot better for those of us that play guitar and moving down a scale while the music is running up a scale just didn't make sense in our heads (what kept me on hard instead of expert). I can finally sell off my 2 guitars, Guitar Hero 2, and that 80's tribute Guitar Hero (name slips my mind) on Craig's list or maybe e-bay.

***EDIT   
**I decided to add the .zip of the Writer for ease of download.
