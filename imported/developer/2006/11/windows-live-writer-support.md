So, I just downloaded some kewl additions for the site, one in particular being the Windows Live Writer Plugin.

I must say that its pretty kewl, I have liked Windows Live Writer since it was announced, and now it just really blows my mind to be able to use it on my own website, and actually keep updates flowing!

[Windows Live Writer][1]

[Community Server Plugin For Windows Live Writer][2]

Good lord... Am I turning into a blog freak?
