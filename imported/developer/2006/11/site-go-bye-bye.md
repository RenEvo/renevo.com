For now anyway, it seems that our server got locked up in a building.  Seriously sucks, the site was starting to get an average of 10 registrations a day, the forum posting was up, etc...

Then BAM, site goes down, and we may not get our data from the server for a while yet.  No fret, it isn't lost, just missing in action.

**Why did I choose Community Server**

My work is currently checking out this software to host our developer site on, and I wanted to have a live demonstration and get familliar with the system myself, so far it seems all right, there are some quirks I am trying to get around, and the default theme is seriously _eh_.

Anyway, I must get home to the wife, going to watch Memoirs of a Geisha on our new Zoom Box
