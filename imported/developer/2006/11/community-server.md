So, after some careful considerations, I am getting happier and happier with the usage of this system.

It was a bit clunky from what I am used to using, then again, it does also have the support for a full website instead of just forums.

I will be grabbing the SDK this weekend to see what comes of it, I am pretty sure with my skills as a .Net programmer I can come up with some sort of graceful methodology for adding some missing functionality.

Also, the default theme thing is driving me nutz, going to spend some time trying to make this thing work, although it seems that its a big of an undertaking.  Maybe I will just build the theme from scratch, as the skinning process for the site is actually pretty well done.

Off to work I go, I am sure you will see quite a bit more updates here, especially considering now that I have found a way to blog on the site with my Windows Live Writer.  Just gotta install the plugins ![Stick out tongue][1]
