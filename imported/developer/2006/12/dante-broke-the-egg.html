<p>Far Cry's crygame.dll - the comstock load for all the game logic in
Far Cry - has come into focus for the C&amp;C Far Cry
project.&nbsp;&nbsp; FINALLY.&nbsp; The tears you see: they are
real.&nbsp; It's taken me awhile to get my composure straightened
out.&nbsp; I'm sooo happy.&nbsp; *gasps for air*</p><p>Give me a minute... <span style="font-style:italic;">talks amongst yourselves</span>. </p><p>Ok,
back to reality.&nbsp; Pardon the stupidity of that opening.&nbsp;
Being a software engineer (just half a year shy of receiving my
bachelors of science) I am most comfortable in the C++ programming
language.&nbsp; I can solve any problem, write any rule, and do it very
lean and fast.&nbsp; What that means for you is a better game in a
shorter amount of time.&nbsp; Up until now, all of our code has been
situated on the Lua (an external scripting language comparable to mIRC
scripting only a lot more open ended) for several reasons, namely to
speed up development and to have the code out in the open for others to
build off of and modify.&nbsp; For us, having a strong mod community is
important, and Lua lets us build a strong game that at the same time is
very accessible for you to build a strong mod.&nbsp;</p><p>Now just
because we're migrating some of our code into C++ does not mean we are
compromising our principles.&nbsp; It means just the opposite.&nbsp;
Our intentions are to hide only the nitty-gritty details that are heavy
in math and computational paradigms.&nbsp; We can speed up these items,
making the game faster and overall better for you.&nbsp; With access to
the net code, rendering methods, and script objects, we can improve the
performance of the game while also putting newer items into Lua that
you - the modder - can use.&nbsp; Items which would otherwise be
totally inaccessible for the average mod team.</p><p>For example: Far
Cry has no actual tanks anywhere within the shipped version of the
game.&nbsp; They are not part of the game. They are in C&amp;C Far
Cry.&nbsp; Because of this, turrets on vehicles update their
orientations unrealisticly when compared to how a tank works.&nbsp;
Where ever you look, that is where your turret points.&nbsp; By gaining
access to the DLL, we will be able to implant a capped movement speed
on turrets, forcing them to move towards where you are looking at at a
defined speed, making it look and feel more realistic.&nbsp; We - and
by that includes you - would not have been able to do this from the
available resources in the Lua environment for this game.&nbsp; What we
will do besides add this ability is also extract the speed setting for
a turret on a vehicle to the Lua script for that vehicle, enabling you
to define this max speed from inside the Lua script.&nbsp; Now
something that you couldn't do can now be done very, very easily.</p><p>It's 3 in the morning.&nbsp; Cut me some slack here.&nbsp;</p><p>Over
the holiday period, we will be porting a lot of foundation code into
the DLL and perform some clean up in our Lua stock code.&nbsp; Some
core features - like the one mentioned above - are also planned.&nbsp;
C&amp;C FarCry is going to prove to be a testing ground for some of the
concepts we have in mind for C&amp;C: The Dead 6.&nbsp; There are going
to be some pretty exciting things going on in the next few months, so
stick around.<br>
