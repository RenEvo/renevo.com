<p>Here is a quick tutorial for all you <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Tom.D.Anderson" target="_blank">Facebook</a> users.</p>  <p>It annoyed me that when I added links from my website, the images that were given were “eh” at best, and usually from some random blog post. I had followed a tutorial that I found on using the image_src meta, but it just didn’t work for me.</p>  <p>Here is my process</p>  <p>First thing I did was open up my site in my browser, I then “zoomed” out a bit to get more content in the view (I use a widescreen monitor).&#160; I then took a decent centered screenshot (OneNote screen clipping is awesome), in Photoshop I tweaked it a bit to my liking so that it was nice and centered.&#160; I then exported as a 200x175 png file and named it “renevo.thumb.png”</p>  <p><img src="http://www.renevo.com/images/renevo.thumb.png" /> </p>  <p>Uploaded to my web site, then added this tiny bit of HTML to the site header.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>&lt;img src=”/images/</em><em>renevo</em><em>.thumb.png” alt=”” style=”display:none;” /&gt;</em></p> </blockquote>  <p>This doesn’t effect my website’s layout at all, and since it is set to display:none “most” browsers will not download the image.</p>  <p>And, for the result when sharing a link on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Tom.D.Anderson" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/Tom.D.Anderson"><img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;display:inline;border-top:0px;border-right:0px;" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/developer/image_4F55F0B8.png" width="473" height="222" /></a></p>  <p>So… super easy way to add a 100% available website thumbnail. </p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2239" width="1" height="1">
