As you all know, or should have known, Microsoft's Professional Developer Conference, or PDC, took place recently.  For those of us not in a position to visit, Microsoft has been so kind to post videos of all the sessions as well as their accompanying power point presentations.

You can visit this [Microsoft Blog Post][2] to download and watch.
