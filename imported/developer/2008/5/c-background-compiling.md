With Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (now in beta), C# gets one of those huge features that turned me off to the language in the first place, Background Compiling!

_What does this mean???_

Simply put, when you type in an error in the code, you know about it without having to compile, for example.   
![][1]

Product is an invalid object, so therefore it gets a red squiggly without compiling, which is a huge step.

Another example:   
![][2]

Wrong return types, which is nice.

This feature alone will probably get me into C# a lot faster then I was originally planning, this is what dynamic spell checking did for Microsoft Word in my opinion.

Great feature add, and I can't wait for the "official" release of .Net 3.5 SP 1 as well as Visual Studio 2008 SP 1.
