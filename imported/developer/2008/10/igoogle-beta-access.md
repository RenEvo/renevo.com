So, have you heard of the [iGoogle][1] beta yet?

Basically, it is a newly updated view for the [iGoogle][1] home page that moves the tabs to the left side pane, adds the Google chat to the main page, as well as much more robust reading ability of gadgets.  For example, you can now browse each gadget independently to get a full view; like for instance if you navigate to the Gmail gadget, you get full Gmail interaction, without visiting the site, also any RSS gadgets will be expanded to allow you to read the posts within the expanded gadget.

Back to the point, the [iGoogle][1] beta is currently a "developer" only beta, the good news is, you can try it by simply trying out the Google sandbox, answering a few questions (like your name), and having some fun.

And that's about it, personally I have been using the [iGoogle][1] home page almost since it was announced as beta, and without my little "clean" dashboard, I would go out of my mind.  Below is a screenshot of my [iGoogle][1] page, what's yours look like?
