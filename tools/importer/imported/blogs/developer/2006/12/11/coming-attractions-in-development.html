<p>Well, since it has been a few days since my last blog post, I thought I would post up a bit about the coming attractions and what is going on developer wise with RenEvo.</p> <p><strong>C&amp;C FarCry</strong></p> <p>We have cracked the egg, I finally gave approval to vloktboky to crack open the crygame.dll for modification, on this project I was trying to keep from opening the crygame.dll, but at this point in the project, I don't want to have to try any more lua scripting work arounds.&nbsp; We are going to go through some of our lua work arounds now and begin optimizing the code into c++, for example, our "dummy AI" will be moved to c++ for speed.</p> <p><strong>SWGEmuDotNet</strong></p> <p>I just registered the domain "SWGLabs.com" and will be posting up a site for it soon, it isn't high on my priority list right now, but will be expedited the first of the year.&nbsp; I have brought in Anzel to hopefully help me out of my current dip in coding ideas on how to get around some new packet issues, as soon as we work through those, I plan on making that Phase I release that is overdue at the time of writing this by about 3 weeks.</p> <p><strong>Website + CommunityServer</strong></p> <p>I am currently working on some new items that I will write an article on, just to preview, it will be on how to create your own data layer similar to the CommunityServer data layer (don't want to recompile already compiled code), create a class for it, then create the front end controls for it.&nbsp; At first it will be a simplistic data display, then I will move on with articles on some more advanced ideas.&nbsp; I will keep the Sample Page up and use it for my articles from this point forward.&nbsp; I had an amazing response to my last article, and plan on keeping them going until I run out of steam on them.</p> <p><strong>The Dead 6</strong></p> <p>Saving this for last, with all the new staff that C&amp;C FarCry has brought on, we are eagerly trying to finish it up, then move into the Dead 6 project.&nbsp; It isn't dead, we are actually finalyzing a bit of stuff trying to get our heads squared on the concept, and working between EA and Crytek to keep things in order legally and development wise.&nbsp;At this point we have an "official", "don't try to sell it or steal the license and you can do it" ok from EA, which it wasn't ever about talking to them and them saying ok, but them saying at least that.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Forums</strong></p> <p>As some of you may have seen, me and vloktboky have opened up two forums for people to come and ask code questions in, we will do our absolute best to answer those questions, and as we see people who start to take part in helping other we will try to reward them in any way that we can.&nbsp; Knowledge is power, but without sharing that knowledge you are just as dumb as the guy sitting next to you.</p> <p><strong>The holidays</strong></p> <p>Don't expect a huge incoming amount of information from us at the site during the holidays, at least from me, I have end of the year software wrap-up, heading home to Indiana for the first time in 6 years, as well as holiday shopping and parties to attend to.&nbsp; It's a busy time of the year.&nbsp; I hope everyone has a great holiday, and look forward to a more prominent year of RenEvo coming back to life with a new face and goal.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=373" width="1" height="1">
