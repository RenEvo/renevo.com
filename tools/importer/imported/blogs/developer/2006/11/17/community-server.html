<P>So, after some careful considerations, I am getting happier and happier with the usage of this system.</P>
<P>It was a bit clunky from what I am used to using, then again, it does also have the support for a full website instead of just forums.</P>
<P>I will be grabbing the SDK this weekend to see what comes of it, I am pretty sure with my skills as a .Net programmer I can come up with some sort of graceful methodology for adding some missing functionality.</P>
<P>Also, the default theme thing is driving me nutz, going to spend some time trying to make this thing work, although it seems that its a big of an undertaking.&nbsp; Maybe I will just build the theme from scratch, as the skinning process for the site is actually pretty well done.</P>
<P>Off to work I go, I am sure you will see quite a bit more updates here, especially considering now that I have found a way to blog on the site with my Windows Live Writer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just gotta install the plugins <img src="http://renevo.com/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /></P><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=30" width="1" height="1">
