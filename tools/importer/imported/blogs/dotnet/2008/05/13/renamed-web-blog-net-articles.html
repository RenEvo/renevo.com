<p>I just renamed this web blog from vb.net articles to .net articles.&#160; I have decided to start blogging all .net now, instead of just vb.net.</p>  <p>More to come later!</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>*<strong>Edit</strong>: I have just realised that in the RSS the images are borked, this will be fixed in the next aggregate, which should occur on next startup, if not, I may have to force a re-aggregation.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1906" width="1" height="1">
