Can’t get into the details, but I may build a project in one of my old stomping grounds just to play with. Should be fun to monkey around in some old API’s, but who knows, I might enjoy it enough to release it, just got to sign off on the release of it with my new job.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Enjoy the holidays!</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2262" width="1" height="1">
