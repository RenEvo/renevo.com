It has been a few years since I have updated the look and feel of the site.</p>  <p>Thinking maybe over the next month or so I might update the look a bit, I don’t think I have the time to do more than that really. And I definitely don’t have the time for a full site rewrite, which I would like to do, considering that the features even with the blog are getting dated (have to use the FTP option now with Live Writer to upload images). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Not to mention that I will probably switch hosting when I redo the site, to cut the costs down quite a bit, as I don’t get nearly the traffic that I used to, but go figure, don’t update your site that often, the traffic slows down.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2264" width="1" height="1">
