In case you didn’t know, due to the final settlement with <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a> and the record companies, they have to limit people to 40 hours a month. Well, I listen to it all day long at work, so this didn’t cut it. Enter <a href="http://www.pandora.com/pandora_one">Pandora One</a>. Basically, <a href="http://www.pandora.com/pandora_one">Pandora One</a> is a $36 a year upgrade that allows me to listen without limitations, without commercials, 5 hours between “are you still listening” messages, as well as getting better quality and a better playlist it seems. At roughly $3 a month, seriously worth the upgrade. The application runs inside of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/" target="_blank">Adobe Air</a>, so if you already have an app like <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com">TweetDeck</a>, you already have the base installed. It has a nice run from tray ability (left side of the image is the tray icon menu) which makes it pretty much totally in the background.</p>  <p>All in all, I say it is worth the upgrade, but then again I am an audiophile who listens to music pretty much the entire time I am on the computer.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2244" width="1" height="1">
