<p>So, it has been a little over a week since my last post, this week has been pretty tight with work.</p>  <p>A few things have popped up in the last few days that have finalized some of the design aspects of the website.&#160; For one, I have decided against the “Entire Post” blog posts, this model didn’t work well with the “<a href="http://facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>/<a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>” type of update system I am planning. Luckily <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a> supports the ability to create “Excerpts” via the Metablog API and the <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a>&#160;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb463260.aspx" target="_blank">“Supports Excerpts” blog configuration</a>. This is a bit more work for me for posting new blogs, but simply pasting a paragraph from the post should do suffice for most cases.</p>  <p>I will hopefully start jotting down some wireframes this week for the basic layouts so I can get started with the feature requirements and get cranking on the code… Which is what this is all about right?</p>  <p>More coming soon…</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2238" width="1" height="1">
