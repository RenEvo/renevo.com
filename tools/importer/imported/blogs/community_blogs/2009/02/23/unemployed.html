<p><img src="http://osmoothie.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/unemployed.jpg" /> </p>  <p>After four great years at my job, Friday I was laid off due to cutbacks from the economies effect on the Restaurant business.</p>  <p>I have a few other job prospects, none of which I am ready to talk about, but still being without steady work sucks ass. Nothing like working at a job, being “part of the family”, then come in on a Friday to get your walking papers and a “good luck”.</p>  <p>Oh well, no sense dwelling in on the negative, I have work to do, err… find.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2165" width="1" height="1">
