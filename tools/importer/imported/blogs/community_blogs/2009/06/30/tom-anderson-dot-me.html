<p>A while back I bought the domain <a href="http://tomanderson.me" target="_blank">TomAnderson.me</a> and have not done anything with it. After digging back into web development last week at work, I decided that I wanted to do some more.</p>  <p><a href="http://tomanderson.me"><img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;border-top:0px;margin-right:auto;border-right:0px;" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_1D546A6A.png" width="644" height="439" /></a></p>  <p>This site will essentially be me moving the “personal” stuff off of <a href="http://www.renevo.com/about.aspx" target="_blank">RenEvo Software &amp; Designs</a> to focus more on development and design (go figure), and give me a place to start fresh, without losing any information. My first thought was to do it here on RenEvo, but I actually like how the site is currently working, so I won’t be messing with it.</p>  <p>The plan is to kind of take my time and create the site to do a few things that I have wanted to do for a while, all in one place, while <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank">keeping a good design and sleek functionality</a>.</p>  <p>BTW, the design you see above is actually a hacked version of my server host <a href="http://www.serverintellect.com/" target="_blank">Server Intellect</a>’s home page, and will <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> be the final, it is only a placeholder to replace the “this site is owned by someone” page that has been there for 6 or so months.</p>  <p>I will be blogging about the process of designing and building the site, from scratch drawings all the way up to code explanations and most likely when I am done, I will release the source to the site for anyone to customize and use.</p>  <p><strong>Technology</strong>: </p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.Net MVC Framework</a> – c#, I love this framework for personal and social websites</li>    <li><a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> – I think enough has been said about this already around the web</li>    <li><a href="http://jqueryui.com/" target="_blank">jQuery UI</a> – For modal windows and some form elements, I definitely like this suite of utilities though</li>    <li><a href="http://openid.net/" target="_blank">OpenId</a> – I will be using OpenId for all “user” related functionality, whether or not I let people register is still undecided.</li>    <li><a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi" target="_blank">Metablog API</a> – I will use this so I can manage the entire site through Window Live Writer</li>    <li><a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a> – Content Management, I use this for all blog and article posting on RenEvo</li> </ul>  <p>So, for those that follow this site’s blogs, and for those that may stumble across it, enjoy the coming articles, I will be spending some considerable time on this, as this is the first site for “me” rather than something else.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2231" width="1" height="1">
