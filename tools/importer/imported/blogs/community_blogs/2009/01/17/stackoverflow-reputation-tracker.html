<p>So, I was feeling a bit antsy at work today, and the results show clearly below.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_61113E07.png"><img title="image" style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;display:inline;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="441" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_thumb_0E94EE7C.png" width="644" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Above you see a wonderful JSON query to the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">stackoverflow</a> site pulling my reputation for the day, highlighting answers in green, items with up and down votes in yellow, and (what i hid) answers with no up votes and all down votes in red. Items with up votes that are not answers and donâ€™t have down votes simply show in vanilla white.</p>  <p>In the task bar it shows my my reputation that I have earned in total for the day.</p>  <p>This is a fun tool, and I hope to add a date selector as well as a tray icon, it is super low bandwidth to the server, as it only pulls on demand, not on a timer or anything.</p>  <p>I realize there are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/so-tool" target="_blank">a lot of other tools just like this one</a>, but I had fun learning how to interact with JSON.</p>  <p>If anyone is interested in it, let me know, I might toss it up open source on <a href="http://code.google.com" target="_blank">Google code</a> or <a href="http://www.codeplex.com" target="_blank">Codeplex</a>.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2140" width="1" height="1">
