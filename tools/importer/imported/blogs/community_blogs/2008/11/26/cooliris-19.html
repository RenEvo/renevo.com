<p>Formerly known as <a href="http://www.piclens.com" target="_blank">PicLens</a>, I canâ€™t explain how much the <a href="http://www.cooliris.com/product" target="_blank">Cooliris</a> plug-in has changed my browsing experience on the web.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.cooliris.com/product"><a><img title="image" style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;display:inline;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="255" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_2C801F9B.png" width="644" border="0" /></a></a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.cooliris.com/product" target="_blank">Cooliris</a> is a plug-in that gives you a 3d wall of images and video in your web browser.&#160; The application is very similar in look and feel to the iPod. I will admit, at first it took a bit of getting used to on big monitors, as I actually felt a bit of motion sickness, but after using it for a while, that feeling went away pretty quick.</p>  <p>You will find that searching and browsing such sites as <a href="http://deviantart.com/" target="_blank">deviantArt</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/imghp" target="_blank">Google Images</a>, <a href="http://photobucket.com/" target="_blank">Photobucket</a>, and even <a href="http://www.myspace.com/stofma" target="_blank">MySpace</a> is changed when using this plug-in, enough with the crappy html, let me see the media!</p>  <p>&#160;<a>RenEvo Supports Cooliris</a></p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2082" width="1" height="1">
