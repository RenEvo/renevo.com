<p><img src="http://www.dcomproductions.net/images/site_logo.png" /></p>  <p>RenEvo Software &amp; Designs is proud to announce itâ€™s first partner community, <a href="http://www.dcomproductions.net/">DCOM Productions .Net</a> or DPDN. With the commonality of our websites, it is only logical to partner with them.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>DPDN is a software development &quot;business&quot;, though not officially. We develop what we think is cool, what we desire. We have made a few products for a few games out there and also a few utilities, and other cool programs. We hope to continue to make great software that we can share with the world. Though I venture to say we just do software development, I also do web development on my part. Locally I make and help people deploy websites for their own use.</em> </p> </blockquote>  <p>Dave Anderson is a colleague of mine who my company is contracting to do some work with our financial integration software.&#160; Dave is quite a bright guy and hopefully our company will be able to snag him up full time and move him out to sunny California.</p>  <p>As a partner, we will be cross posting news, as well as more involved partnerships with our software products, as well as our blogs.</p>  <p>Come back soon for more information on this partnership as the details are worked out! I am very excited about this partnership.</p>  <p>Read more <a href="http://www.dcomproductions.net/index.php?page=about">about</a> <a href="http://www.dcomproductions.net/">DCOM</a> and visit their <a href="http://forums.dcomproductions.net/">forums</a>.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2039" width="1" height="1">
