<p>I have redone the top web logo, turns out I canâ€™t find the original Photoshop file for it, so I just redid it from scratch.&#160; I have also created an affiliate image that others can use *more on that soon*. The key reason to redoing the logo was to remove the hand over the start that showed up in the top right.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/RenEvoLogo_60A56F0C.png"><img title="RenEvoLogo" style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;display:inline;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="84" alt="RenEvoLogo" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/RenEvoLogo_thumb_1063178C.png" width="244" border="0" /></a></p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2038" width="1" height="1">
