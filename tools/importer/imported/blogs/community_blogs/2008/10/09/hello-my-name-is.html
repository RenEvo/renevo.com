<P>Well, its about that time that I drop the “online” nick, as oddly enough, I have people in my life who actually try to call me “Dante”.&nbsp; From now on I will be working to keep my name “Dante” and/or “Denate” for use in online games, and some gaming websites, while my personal website and programming websites, I will attempt to use this ultra common name of “TomAnderson”.</P>
<P>I have a few more announcements to make soon, so stay tuned!</P><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2030" width="1" height="1">
