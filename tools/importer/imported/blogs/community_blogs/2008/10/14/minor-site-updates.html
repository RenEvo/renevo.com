<p>I have worked on the site a bit today, updating some small components to the site.&#160; Below is a list of the current changes.</p>  <p>Removed IRC, Sample, and C&amp;C FarCry from the tabbed browsing links at the top, you can still reach the following links:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.renevo.com/sample/" target="_blank">Sample Page</a></li>    <li><a href="http://www.renevo.com/cncfc/" target="_blank">C&amp;C FarCry</a></li> </ul>  <p>These two pages are considered legacy, and will no longer be updated, but will not be removed.</p>  <p>I have also added the 2 partners to the right, as well as 3 affiliates to the website. RenEvo’s current Microsoft Partner status is “Registered” I am currently working on finishing the requirements for the “Certified” status.</p>  <p>You may notice the addition of the “<a href="http://www.renevo.com/about.aspx" target="_blank">About</a>” page, I will be working on this over the coarse of the next few days, so please bear with me while I update it.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2043" width="1" height="1">
