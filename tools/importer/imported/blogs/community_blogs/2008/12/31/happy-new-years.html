<p>For those about to drink, I salute you.</p>  <p>I will most likely be drinking, playing Rock Band 2, and some random Wii games with some guests at my house tonight, I hope your night goes well!</p>  <p>Tonight is the night when everyone picks out that major flaw in their life and makes a promise that in the new year they will change it, well, why not take the thought out of it?</p>  <p>I recently found this neat little <a href="http://resolutionrandomizer.pop.us/ecard.aspx">Resolution Randomizer</a> online, it is a lot of fun.&#160; Below is my random resolution for next year.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_69FFE311.png"><img title="image" style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;display:inline;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="480" alt="image" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_thumb_3B3CBB20.png" width="644" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Looks like I am going to be Exploring gaining weight next year, and here I am thinking that I need to lose weight! Although I was kind of looking forward to Exploring speaking loudly when Iâ€™m alone.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2117" width="1" height="1">
