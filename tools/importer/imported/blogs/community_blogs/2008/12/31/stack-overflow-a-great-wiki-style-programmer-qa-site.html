<p>Have you found <a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow’s</a> website yet?</p>  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/224232/what-is-the-cost-of-reflection"><img title="image" style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;display:inline;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="484" alt="image" width="569" border="0" src="http://www.renevo.com/blogs/community_blogs/image_121BC43F.png"></a> </p>  <p>Taken from the <a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/about">about page</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Stack Overflow is <b>a programming Q &amp; A site that's free</b>. Free to ask questions, free to answer questions, free to read, free to index, built with plain old HTML, no fake rot13 text on the home page, no scammy google-cloaking tactics, no salespeople, no JavaScript windows dropping down in front of the answer asking for $12.95 to go away. You can register if you want to collect karma and win valuable flair that will appear next to your name, but otherwise, it's just free. And fast. Very, very fast.</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p>We don't run Stack Overflow. <i>You</i> do. Stack Overflow is <b>collaboratively built and maintained by your fellow programmers</b>. Once the system learns to trust you, you'll be able to edit anything, much like <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. With your help, we can build good answers to every imaginable programming question together. No matter what programming language you use, or what operating system you call home -- better programming is our goal.</p>    <p>Stack Overflow is as frictionless and painless to use as we could make it. We believe finding the right answer to your programming questions should be as easy as falling into the pit of success. And maybe even a little fun along the way.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The site is extremely helpful, and with the reputation system and voting system the users really drive to help you find the right answers to your questions.</p>  <p>The website is also a great implementation of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.Net MVC framework</a>. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood</a> worked with the Microsoft team through the pre-releases to build the website and it really shines as an easy to use, easy to navigate, very searchable, great website for its purpose.</p>  <p>If you want to check out my activity, here is a link to my <a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/13502/tom-anderson">Stack Overflow Profile</a>. There you can check out some of my activity on the site, as well as any questions I have asked or answered. The website uses <a target="_blank" href="https://www.myopenid.com/">myOpenID</a> for its authentication, which is basically another open authentication system similar to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_ID">Microsoft’s Live ID</a> system.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=2118" width="1" height="1">
