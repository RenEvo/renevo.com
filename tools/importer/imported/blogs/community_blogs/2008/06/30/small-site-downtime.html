<p>The web site was down for a few days, I was away so I wasn't aware of it.&#160; All has been fixed and we are resuming as expected.&#160; As I may repeat, RenEvo isn't going anywhere and there are a few announcements in the pipe, so stick around.</p><img src="http://renevo.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1966" width="1" height="1">
