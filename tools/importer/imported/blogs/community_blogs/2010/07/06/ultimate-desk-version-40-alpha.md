So, since I haven't built out my own [website][1] yet for posting personal stuff, this site gets it!

Instead of working on some software projects at home, I have decided that it is time to give my office a serious make over. The first step is already in progress.

When we purchased this house, I staked claim to the formal dining room to become my office, my man cave, my off limits for the wife area. The first step was replacing the pseudo chandelier in the middle room with more manly (and higher; kept hitting my head) lights. I now have [3 directional spots][2] that are on a dimmer switch that allow me to go from barely lit, to bright as the sun if needed.

The second step, was to get rid of the one problem with the room; two entrances. There "was" two doors to the formal dining room. One that was directly from the main front door, and one from the kitchen. I opted to keep the door to the kitchen (easy fridge access) and close up the four foot French door opening. Over the last few (I won't say days/weeks/months) I have ripped out the doors, framed it in, and am in the process of finishing up the drywall to completely close it off.

After this is complete, I will be painting the room a [dark blue][3] to darken the rooms atmosphere a bit more (keeping the white ceiling/floor boards, and crown molding for now). Then comes the fun stuff, building the interior of the office.

I have searched literally for months for a desk replacement for my thirty-two inch by six foot cherry "executive" desk to no avail. Everything from [Ikea][4], [Herman Miller][5], and [about everything in between][6]. Nothing really seemed to be a good fit for what I wanted, and ALL of them were so shallow. I have used this desk for literally 8 years, and am used to the depth it has. I could easily fit 2 CRT monitors (back in the day), my keyboard, and still keep my elbows on the desk; which is a requirement, I like my arms up to the elbows, up on the desk. So, in the spirit of DIY, I am going to roll my own.

There is one catch to this, it has to be epic.

I am a musician, I spend a lot of time gaming, I am an audiophile, and I like to watch movies and [Hulu][7] on the computer. This new ultimate desk has to support this, and my office also has to be atmospheric for it at well.

The first brainstorming was to just take my desk, turn it around, add some shelves and some book cases and be done with it, but that only meets one of my needs, and that isn't very epic. Eventually I settled on a cross between a pseudo studio, a [guitar rack based system][8], and a "[control room][9]" look & feel.

Right now on my desk I have about 20 different peripherals, from gaming to phones, to iStuff, 3d glasses and IR blaster, USB hubs, studio speakers, cable box, surround sound speakers, headphones, and a headset for gaming. Not to mention my keyboard/mouse. I then figured out that 90% of this can be [custom][10] [rack mounted][11], and that they could go into my "control center" quiet nicely.

So the idea is that I will buy a bunch of [project boxes][12], mangle the crap out of a lot of peripherals to put them in the boxes, and rack mount them in an easy to reach location, while mixing in my "real" rack mounted equipment (guitar effects, EQ, bass effects, etc…) for quick access. Then stick my [monitors][13] and speakers inside of the racks, make a keyboard/mouse storage compartment, mount a [touch screen][14] below the [main monitor][15], and end up with the most epic desk/desktop that sits in the corner of the room, where the old door pretty much was. And to top it all off, I don't want the run of the mill forty-five degree corner desk, I am going to build a nineteen degree desk and build it out to forty five on the extensions, giving me a spot to run [studio monitor speakers][16] on stands behind the "control rack". Then the right side of my desk will be capped out with a book case / file cabinet, and the right side will house my guitar cabinets (stored inside a book case). Above the guitar cabinets I plan on mounting all of my guitars with a switch for lighting each one (wall mounted LED). The remainder of the wall will be book case/storage for "stuff".

The real kicker is that above my control center, I want to mount a forty inch [LCD][17] (not yet purchased) that points down at a ten degree angle. This way I can watch it while playing games or surfing the web – or jump back to the sofa (not yet found) on the other side of the room and just kick back. Next to the sofa? A bookshelf with all my nerd books (programming books), a place for me to charge up my iPad, and a [reading light mounted off the wall][18].

Well, that's the goal, lots of work building everything out over the next few months; tons of things to buy (already started getting [some things][19] – more later); and tons of drawing/modeling to do to mock up the things to build.

My goal is to finish this by the end of the year, and kick back and enjoy the ultimate desk, control center, entertainment center, recording studio, sanctuary, and man cave I can imagine that is perfect for "me".

Here is the first box out of the desk, I plan on adding a lot more detail to it, getting some of the shapes figured out, and starting to do some placement for the peripherals in the rack kits.

Stay tuned for some progress pictures of me tearing the door out and filling it in. I want to post them all at the same time.
